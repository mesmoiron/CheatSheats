# Data Science project

* Question type: descriptive, exploratory, inferential, causal, predictive, mechanistic
  * Data
      * EDA:
        * __exploratory data analysis__, sketch an answer to your question
        * data suitable for answering the question
      * Formal Modeling
        * specifically write down the question
        * challenging framework, the result
    * Interpretation
        * Assemble the pieces of information and interpret the quality of evidence
    * Communication
        * Decision

* Data: start with some data you have
  * EDA
  * Question
  * More Data
    * EDA: start evaluating the question on newly added data
    * Formal Modeling
    * Interpretation
    * Communication
      * Decision

## Steps in data analysis
1. Colecting Data/Reading codebooks
2. Summarizing Data
3. Interpreting Data

## Datasets and Codebooks/Datadictionaries
* Review the variables
* List numerical variables
* List categorical variables
* Determine their units of measure

## Developing Research Question
* Review the code books for the datasets
  1. Select Datasets
  2. Identify a specific topic of interests
  3. Create/print a personal codebook with only includes the variables you are interested in
  4. Develop the research question:
    1. Are two variables related/associated to each other?
    2. Identify the variables that measure the first topic of the association in the dataset
    3. Identify the variables that measure the second topic of the association in the dataset
    4. Ask the next question that preferably hasn't been answered yet.
5. Add questions/items/variables documenting this second topic to your personal codebooks
  6. Perform a literature review what research previously has been done on this topic (biblio)
  7. Based on the review develop a hypothesis about what you believe the association  might be between these topics. Integrate the specific variables you selected

## Review:
* select dataset and indicate selection
* clearly state research question and hypothesis
* literature review: include search terms
* literature review: identify references used
* literature review: present summary of findings, variables considered, patterns of findings
