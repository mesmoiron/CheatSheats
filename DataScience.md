  * Forecasting
4. Prescriptive: what do we need to do?

## Solutions multiple teams
1. Team one works traditional on levels 1/2
2. Team two works with scientific hypotheses on levels 3/4

## SPAP Structured Pyramid Analysis Plan
1. Top: smart goal with dependent variables/metrics
2. Middle: detail questions with independent variables
  1. logical structure: categories, issues addressed
  2. split the large categories up in subgroups/questions/metrics
3. Bottom: visualizations with explanations/narratives
